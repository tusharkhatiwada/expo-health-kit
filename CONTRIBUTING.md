# Contributing to expo-health-kit

We love your input! We want to make contributing to expo-health-kit as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issue tracker](https://github.com/yourusername/expo-health-kit/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/expo-health-kit/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Development Process

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Make your changes
4. Run tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
5. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Testing

We use Jest for testing. Please ensure all new code includes appropriate tests:

```bash
npm test
```

## Coding Style

- Use TypeScript
- Follow the existing code style
- Use meaningful variable names
- Comment your code when necessary
- Keep functions small and focused
